# Changes from the documentation
## API contracts
- In the documentation, in some cases UUID parameters are represented by a string while in others it is UUID. We could not understand why because there were no explanation.
- In the Product POST method, removed "created" and "updated" parameters because they are unnecessary and can be known from the system.
